# Developing and publishing Visual Studio Code extensions

## Intro

VsCode is great, but you could make it greater

## You can

- Change the look of VS Code with a color or icon theme - Theming
- Add custom components & views in the UI - Extending the Workbench
- Create a Webview to display a custom webpage built with HTML/CSS/JS
- Support a new programming language - Language Extensions Overview

### What you usually would do

- Register commands
- Display notifications
- Collect user input
- Create code snippets
- Connect to external servers

## What we will create

Develop an extension that will execute saved commands on the vscode integrated terminal

## Developing the extension

1. The easiest way to start developing vscode extensions is to clone the [hello world example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-minimal-sample)

2. Open the official VsCode [extension API docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)
